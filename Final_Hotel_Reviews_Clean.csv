0,Eden_Lodge_Paris-Paris_Ile_de_France,"We decided to stay one night at this ‘hotel’ at the end of a trip to Paris because of the reviews, and it’s relative closeness to the Gare de Lyon, which we arrived to by TGV.  First thing to note: The hotel has no cooling system, so for stays in the summer when temperatures can be in the 30s, it’s not your best bet. The air in the upstairs common area was stuffy and hot. Our room was better because we could open the large floor to ceiling window, but there are lots of mosquitos (because of a dank, and dirty small pool / tub in the front yard ) and all the bees on the property, so opening windows is not a good option. The Dyson ventilator in the room doesn’t help- I don’t believe it’s a fan, maybe an air purifier?

We had tried to call several times but no one was answering the phone. We tried to buzz on the door communication button but no one responded.

The location is convenient enough with a great bus just outside that takes you to the Marais and onwards, and a subway station close by as well.

The beds are super comfortable and the bathroom was so beautiful that we had to photograph it...

Also, the shower head holder was falling off so we had to hold the shower head (which is common in Europe, but inconvenient for an American who is used to fixed shower heads) They ended up fixing it though, so it was good.

Let me preface this by saying I usually stay in five-star hotels when I travel (obviously more $$ but you usually know what you'll get). For this trip, I decided to give Hotel Pulitzer a try since I was traveling by myself and just wanted a cute hotel that was centrally located and safe. After reading the TripAdvisory reviews, I booked Hotel Pulitzer -- no regrets! It was great and perfect all around. The room was small, but VERY clean (modern & clean bathroom - big plus).

Not far from Bastille square.   - Hotel is very fresh because of its transformation from Adriatic Hotel to Locomo Hotel.   Disadvantages  - I payed for my stay a week before and had confirmation. But when I came to hotel, I needed to pay extra costs (taxes) - plus 5,64 euro. It could be more convenient to pay once, not two times.  - Sound insulation could be better – you hear what your neighbor doing.

5085,Hotel_Amiral_Fondary-Paris_Ile_de_France,"Stayed at this hotel for one night in January whilst seeing the sights of the city.  The hotel is in a good location located very close to the Eiffel Tower and the metro.   The hotel is very small and it appears they’ve spent some money doing up the communal areas.   Our room was on the top floor, 504, the bedroom was clean and the bed was a king size. It was snug but there was everything you needed for a nights stay.   The bathroom could do with abit more attention - the tiling looked very dated as did the toilet brush which was disgusting and far too close to the shower in my opinion! The shower itself was good pressure and temperature.   The stay were pleasant and they allowed us to check in early and leave our bags when we checked out.   Overall a good hotel if you are",3.0,"Swindon, United Kingdom",63,21,Good,Trip type: Travelled as a couple,"['#1,389 of 1,868 hotels in Paris']",['US$92 - US$254 (Based on Average Rates for a Standard Room) '],74,92,254,0,1,0

For a small, cost effective, 3 star in Paris, they were friendly and courteous throughout, waited until very late to check her in (delayed Eurostar) and gave her a lovely room.

5087,Hotel_Amiral_Fondary-Paris_Ile_de_France,"Such a great experience to be here.  Easy to get to from the train station.  Actually all subways in Paris are easy to navigate.  The hotel is really close to everything, Eiffel, Champs Elysees, Arc de Triumph.  And lots of Brasseries.  Markets, bakeries and coffee shops.  A safe neighbourhood. The room was great.  Very comfortable beds.  A breakfast is only $10EU each daily, far more cost effective than buying outside the hotel.  Save your money for lunch or dinner.  Lovely staff, so very friendly and helpful.  This is a family owned and managed hotel.  We'll go back here for sure.",5.0,"London, Canada",101,21,We loved this hotel!,,"['#1,389 of 1,868 hotels in Paris']",['US$92 - US$254 (Based on Average Rates for a Standard Room) '],85,92,254,0,1,0
5088,Hotel_Amiral_Fondary-Paris_Ile_de_France,"This hotel is located at a very good location (several metro stations within a few minutes walk), the street is quiet and there are shops, restaurants and a bakery nearby. Eiffel Tower is just a 15 minute walk. Bikes (velib) can be found in the next street.  The staff was great, very friendly and they all spoke English.  The hotel as well as the rooms is really small but you are in Paris and the room is the last place you want to be and the least time you should spend in. The room was small but clean and neat. Some mold on the ceiling in the bathroom, but nothing alarming. The door to the room did not close well and in the night one could see light from the corridor coming through the gap. There is a small courtyard behind the hotel with 4-5 tables to enjoy a cup of coffee or",3.0,"Perth, Australia",8,21,Quiet small hotel at a nice location,Trip type: Travelled with family,"['#1,389 of 1,868 hotels in Paris']",['US$92 - US$254 (Based on Average Rates for a Standard Room) '],56,92,254,0,1,0
5089,Hotel_Amiral_Fondary-Paris_Ile_de_France,"We stayed at this hotel in our recent trip to Paris, it’s a very small hotel but maintained well and all the staff we encountered are very friendly. The rooms are small but ok for a couple who is spending most of the time out of the hotel, the walls are thin so you do have to be careful about how much noise you are making. There’s a lovely cat that lives in the hotel as well. Breakfast was basic but fine if your just running out of the door. The location is close to the Eiffel Tower and a street of local shops and places to eat. Wouldn’t recommend this hotel if you don’t like to leave your room key at reception everytime you leave the premises. The shower in our room was fantastic and now we would love one at home!
