      "We decided to stay one night at this ‘hotel’ at the end of a trip to Paris because of the reviews, and it’s relative closeness to the Gare de Lyon, which we arrived to by TGV.  First thing to note: The hotel has no cooling system, so for stays in the summer when temperatures can be in the 30s, it’s not your best bet. The air in the upstairs common area was stuffy and hot. Our room was better because we could open the large floor to ceiling window, but there are lots of mosquitos (because of a dank, and dirty small pool / tub in the front yard ) and all the bees on the property, so opening windows is not a good option. The Dyson ventilator in the room doesn’t help- I don’t believe it’s a fan, maybe an air purifier?  The property has no sign outside, and it’s easy to miss if\n",
      "\n",
      "Having had experiences with other establishments/hotels in the ‘I Love Eco Hotels’ Chain and by the looks of photos and the reviews on booking.com made for this Eden Lodge then I will have to say that the disappointment is quite high.  The entrance is a large port from the street with a small sign on the wall next to the port. We stood outside for about 20 minutes before someone opened the doors for us. We had tried to call several times but no one was answering the phone. We tried to buzz on the door communication button but no one responded.  From the photos it looks like you have this large beautiful garden space with nice places to sit outside, in reality its a small backyard garden with a minimum maintenance and not very inviting to use the garden nor the tables and chairs.\n",
      "\n",
      "We loved everything about Eden Lodge!   The location is convenient enough with a great bus just outside that takes you to the Marais and onwards, and a subway station close by as well.  The Hotel itself is charming, with a peaceful garden, interior designs inspired by the 50ies and 60ies, and smelling wonderfully of fresh wood.  The beds are super comfortable and the bathroom was so beautiful that we had to photograph it...   The breakfast is set up in the charming kitchen and is small but with everything you need (fresh coffee, bread, butter, jam, cheeses, ham, fruit salad, yoghurt and croissants...). Everything was of great quality and presented with love and care.  The staff is equally lovely!   A small word of caution - be sure to bring the codes for the two doors before you\n",
      "\n",
      "It's little bit tricky to find it if you arrive at night time so you need to count on your navi :) Hotel is nicely hidden behind two massive doors. It's like a nice kindersurprise :)  Very eco friendly hotel, nice and confortable design. Surprisingly big bath, surely for two :) Japanese loo! Clean, comfortable bed, realy good and rich breakfast.  Friendly and helpful personell. Lot's of plases to eat or go out around.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wonderfully hidden behind an inconspicuous door lies this green oasis. Rooms are spacious and well equipped. Breakfast is far above Parisian standards and the hosts are impeccable. The lodge is located within 3-4min walking distance from the subway.\n",
